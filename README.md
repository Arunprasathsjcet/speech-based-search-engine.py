# Speech-Based Search Engine

This Python project enables users to perform web searches using voice commands. It utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to create an interactive voice-controlled interface for searching the web via Google.

## Features

* Voice-activated search
* Real-time speech recognition using Google API
* Spoken feedback using text-to-speech
* Opens search results in the default web browser

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* [speechrecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
* [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
* [pyaudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or download the script.

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> Note: You may need to install PortAudio before installing PyAudio (especially on Linux or macOS).

## Usage

1. Ensure your microphone is working.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python "speech based search engine.py"
```

3. Speak your search query when prompted.
4. The search results will open in your default web browser.

## Troubleshooting

* **Speech not recognized**: Make sure your microphone is not muted and background noise is minimal.
* **PyAudio issues**: Refer to your OS-specific instructions for installing PyAudio (e.g., using `brew install portaudio` on macOS).
